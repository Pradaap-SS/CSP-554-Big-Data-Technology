# CSP 554 Big Data Technology

# Instructor:	
Joseph Rosen

# Course Description

Big data is the area of informatics focusing on datasets whose size is beyond the ability of typical database and other software tools to capture, store, analyze and manage. This course provides a rapid immersion into the area of big data and the technologies which have recently emerged to manage it.  We start with an introduction to the characteristics of big data and an overview of the associated technology landscape and continue with an in depth exploration of Hadoop, the leading open source framework for big data processing. Here the focus is on the most important Hadoop components such as Hive, Pig, stream processing and Spark as well as architectural patterns for applying these components. We continue with an exploration of the range of specialized (NoSQL) database systems architected to address the challenges of managing large volumes of data. Overall the objective is to develop a sense of how to make sound decisions in the adoption and use of these technologies. Prerequisites: CS 425 or equivalent.
